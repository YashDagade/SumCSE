## Contrastive Learning of Sentence embeddings from scratch
This repository contains the code, datasets and pre-trained models for our paper [Contrastive Learning of Sentence embeddings from scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15077).
**************************** **Updates** ****************************

Thanks for your interest in our repo!

Wait a minute! The authors are working day and night ðŸ’ª, to make the code and models available, so you can explore our state-of-the-art sentence embeddings.
We anticipate the code will be out * **in one week** *.
